A Programmable Text Editor for Windows.

The scripting language is [FsMiniMAL](https://github.com/nshibano/FsMiniMAL). It covers common language constructs of ML languages (OCaml, F#, etc.). The interpreter is specially designed to provide sandboxing functionarity, thus, even if the running script contains bug and it crashes, the application doesn't crash and user doesn't lose the editing text data.
